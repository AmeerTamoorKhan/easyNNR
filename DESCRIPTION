Description: A single-function solution for building, training, and evaluating 
    neural networks in R with comprehensive preprocessing capabilities. Designed 
    for beginners and researchers who want quick results without deep learning 
    expertise. easyNNR handles preprocessing (outlier detection, target transformation,
    class imbalance, feature selection, encoding, imputation, and more), model 
    building, training, evaluation, and visualization automatically while still 
    allowing advanced users to customize every aspect of the pipeline.
    Compatible with TensorFlow 2.15.0 and Keras 2.15.0.
